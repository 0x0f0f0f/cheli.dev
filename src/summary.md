I like compilers and metaprogramming. My academic areas of focus are applied
category theory, functional programming, symbolics, and the theory and design of
programming languages. I maintain different open source projects, mostly related
to metaprogramming, rewriting systems and theory of programming languages, such
as [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl). While I
mostly work in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language at
[PlantingSpace](https://planting.space), I am also very comfortable around
modern Typescript and most other functional languages. I like fast-paced,
multidisciplinary work environments. I also focus on experimental electronic
music, releasing my music under the name "Contraddizione" on [Music is Logic is
Geometry](https://milig.online). I'm interested in digital sound design, analog
synthesizers and machines that make sound. You can find me in [680Hz
Studios](https://680.studio) in Berlin.
