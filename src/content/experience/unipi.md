I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. My [thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14714.pdf) proposes an advanced, generic and high-level code rewriting and analysis system for the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org), and was supervised by Professors [Gian-Luigi Ferrari](https://dblp.org/pid/f/GianLuigiFerrari.html), [Andrea Corradini](https://pages.di.unipi.it/corradini/) and Dr. [Christopher Rackauckas](https://chrisrackauckas.com/)
