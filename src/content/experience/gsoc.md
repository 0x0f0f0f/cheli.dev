During GSoC 2021, I was awarded a stipend from Google for an experiment involving the integration of [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl), my thesis project, with the high performance Computer Algebra System (CAS) [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) developed at MIT. The project focused on automatically applying user-defined [high-level compiler optimizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14714.pdf), defined via equational rewrite rules, to preemptively choose the symbolic representation of a system of differential equations that performs best when compiled and solved numerically. The projects are still being maintained and there is still room for exploring and researching the topic.
