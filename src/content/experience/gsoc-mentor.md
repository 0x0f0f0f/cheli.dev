During GSoC 2024, I mentored [Niklas Heim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6gmkzcAAAAJ&hl=en)'s project [OptiFloat.jl]().
Based on my project [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Metatheory.jl),
OptiFloat.jl rewrites floating point expressions to more accurate alternatives.
It is a pure **Julia implementation of [Herbie](https://herbie.uwplse.org/)**.
To learn more about what OptiFloat does, how to use it, and how it works check out the [**documentation**](https://nmheim.github.io/OptiFloat.jl/).
